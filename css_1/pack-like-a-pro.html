      When packing clothing, consider the season's typical climate but be ready for all conditions. In Victoria, it's common to experience multiple weather conditions in one day, so don't forget your wet-weather gear, long layers to equally protect from UV rays and frost, and footwear for multiple activities. Check the weather and pack the right clothing and you are ready to rock and roll.
