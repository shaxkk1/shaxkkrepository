"""
Explanation of how the code meets each criterion:
Descriptive Variable Names:
student_list, student_name, student_grade, choice are all descriptive and easy to understand.
Three Distinct Data Types:
String: student_name and choice are strings.
Float: student_grade is a float representing the student's grade.
List: student_list is a list that stores dictionaries (representing students and their grades).
Decision Making with Decision Structures:
The program uses if-elif-else decision structures to handle the userâ€™s menu choices (add student, view students, calculate average grade, remove student, or exit).
Repeated Tasks with Looping Structures:
The while True loop allows the user to repeatedly interact with the menu options until they choose to exit.
Reusable Functions:
Functions such as display_menu, add_student, view_students, calculate_average_grade, and remove_student are modular and reusable, each performing a specific task.
Collections of Data with Sequences (Lists):
The student_list is a list that stores dictionaries. Each dictionary holds a student's name and grade. The program iterates through this list in the view_students and calculate_average_grade functions.
Documentation:
Each function has a docstring that describes its purpose and parameters. For example, the add_student function explains that it adds a new student and their grade to the list, and the calculate_average_grade function explains that it calculates the average grade of all students in the list.
